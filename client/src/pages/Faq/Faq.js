        <ul className="faq__list">
            <li>Avoid taking any NSAIDS 2 weeks prior to treatment (Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Advil, Motrin) as these medications act as blood thinners.</li>

            <li>Avoid wearing makeup- come with your beautiful natural face!</li>
            <li>HYDRATE! Drinks as much water as you can!</li>
